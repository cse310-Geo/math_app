# Overview

This software is a team effort. We are a group of software engineers who want to create a geometry tutorial website for secondary school students.

Our Team:

- Connor Baltich
- David Balladares
- Josifini Tamanalevu
- Brandon McFadden
- Julie Antezana

The web app has tutorial lessons about geometry topics. Each lesson has a quiz to help the student practice what they have learned and measure their success. Students can earn points and rewards as they progress through the lessons.

How to start a test server on your computer:
